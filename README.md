# Spamming-with-Whatsapp-Web-and-Selenium
I have worked on small 10 line code for using Automated Message sending using Selenium and whatsapp's Web service in whatsapp. 

**Requirements:**
  1. Python 3.5+ or Anaconda
  2. Selenium Package (can do using pip install in anaconda Prompt: ```pip install selenium ```)
  3. someone to get spammed. :)

**Things to keep in mind while using it.**
1. It works in *infinite* loop without termination, so if you want to stop it you can *add counter* to specific number or *exit the code*.
2. When it opens the Web Whatsapp window you have to connect it with your phone (by scanning QR Code). 
3. Once you do step 2 you have to go back to your compiler and *input any value* in the prompt and it will start showing it magic.
